I'm trying to write a solver for a puzzle a firend gave me 

It's a triangular case with hexagonal pieces, three pieces high

     /.\
    /. .\
   /. . .\
  /. . . .\
 /. . . . .\
 ----------

There are 11 pieces, all two layers thick 


- =  hexagon on bottom payer only
| =  hexagon on top layer only
+ =  hexagon on both layers

                           
1       + - -              
                           
                           
2        |                 
          + -              
                           
3         -                
           - +             
                           
4        - + -             
                           
                           
5       | + -              
                           
          -                
6        + |               
                           
           -               
7         + -              
                           
          - -              
8        - +               
                           
           - -             
9         - +              
                           
              -            
10         + -             
                           
                           
11          -              
             + |
